 <h1>The Tower

<h2>System Analysis and Usability
</h2>


<p>The home page for The Tower is cluttered. It is jam-packed from the huge title that takes up the top half of a desk-top/laptop/tablet screen, to the thin crawl with small flashing icon, to the huge color-saturated thumbnail images lined up in a grid. The page has multiple heuristic design flaws and weaknesses that, however, become strengths when viewed on a cell phone. This critique will only focus on the placement for the archives on the landing page in large screen format, as well as, the design that favors small device formats, and evaluate search capabilities. 
</p>
 
<p>When accessed on a desktop, many of the flaws violate Nielson’s eighth heuristic principle: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design. The placement of the “archive” on the home page for the college newspaper is unnecessary. The Tower archive is important information that requires its own dedicated page and listing on the navigation bar, rather than being crammed onto the landing page. However, the archive panel runs down the right side of the page in a single-item (month/year) format from November 2024 to September 2015. The linked monthly publication dates continue past the end of thumbnails indicating featured articles for the current or searched for dates. The archives panel proceeds past links indicating 330 pages just like this one. The list of dates continues down the right side of a long stretch of white space. Finally scrolling upon two very oddly placed ads for the business school, past a duplicate of some of the previously listed articles “you may have missed” comes the bottom page band with the very same archival listing in the same long, single item format. 
</p>

<p>First impressions of the consistent page design presents a concept that prioritizes filling every white space with information, thus threatening cognitive overload. Next, the tenth heuristic principle—Help and Documentation—is also violated by the page crammed with information. There is no space to explain the number below each month/year. After taking the time to figure out that the numbers represented the number of articles in the archives for that time period, the question remains. Why do some months have 1 or two articles, while others have up to 100 articles. With a page dedicated to the archives, such clarifying information can be included.

<p>While looking for good images on my phone, I inadvertently discovered that The Tower site is better adaptable to small screen formats. The page is designed with student-on-the-go simplicity when viewed on a cell phone screen, which is the device of choice for college-aged learners and users. While the placement of the archive is problematic in both small and large-screen formats, on a cell phone the design is logical. 
</p>

<p>First appears the reasonably sized titled surrounded by lots of white space. Next is the black navigation banner with minimalist design: three short white stacked lines indicating click for a list of navigation options, and the white magnifying glass indicating a search bar are all that appear. Next is the yellow banner with a pulsating bullet point indicating “flash story” above a thin crawl of links to articles of interest. It is a well-placed quick reference tool since the articles for the month are listed by thumbnail in a single file as you scroll down the cell phone page. This time, the user scrolls to the end of the archives with the only wasted white space being the result of the single file format rather than columns. The two business school ads are perfectly placed, yet the bottom band again displays archive links in the same long-list format.

<p>An information seeker, particularly a college freshmen, would find The Tower archive useful when seeking to explore CUA student attitudes about relevant social issues. A keyword for “abortion,” for example, returns eight pages of articles on the topic going all the way back to December 2015; while, a search for the term “Black Lives Matter” returns three articles. However, if the student searches the term without prentices (“ ”) they will get five pages of results, with multiple relevant returns. Most were false results that can waste an inexperienced student’s time. The system can be improved by following Nielson’s tenth principle that calls for “Help and Documentation.” A simple short explanation of how to search would make the process more user-friendly for students. Further, once on an article page, the searched for keyword or phrase should be highlighted to make scanning for pertinence easier.
</p>


<p>One thing the site does right is embedding links in the article to credible outside sources such as The Washington Post, The New York Times, NPR, CNN, as well as in-house sources. Another strength is the flexibility of the key word search or clicking on the known month and year for the information the user is seeking. While The Tower information system is a good source for exploring student attitudes at any given time up to 2015, teachers should be aware of and possibly prepare students for the difficulties they will encounter. A quick assessment by the teacher will reveal the following:
</p>
<p>
Weaknesses
<ul> 
<li>Lack of instructions.</li>
<li>Irrelevant returns.</li> 
<li>Interface, when viewed on large screens, is not user friendly.</li>
</ul>

Strengths
<ul>
<li>User friendly design on cell phone.</li>
<li>In-document links to supporting articles in reputable outside sources, which can also become part of the assignment.</li>
<li>Flexibility to search by keywords or browse the months and years.</li>
</ul>
